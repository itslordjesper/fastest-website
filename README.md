# World's Fastest Website!

This is the fastest website on the internet, according to [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/bDpLrK/https://itslordjesper.github.io/fastest-website/index.html). Hosted by Github's super fast servers and scoring 100/100 on [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=sv&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitslordjesper.github.io%2Ffastest-website%2Findex.html).

It does'nt contain much, no CSS, no JS just plain HTML.
It's a pretty useless website actually.
